<h2> Data Structure Project of Graph in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original-wordmark.svg" alt="python" width="35" height="35" /> </h2>
<p allign="left">
<br> Implemented classes : </br>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp ✔ Node </br>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp ✔ LinkedList + Queue ( Unecessary to next classes ) </br>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp ✔ Edge + Vertex ( for Graph class ) </br>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp ✔ Graph ( with implemented algorithms like BFS, DFS, visualisation ) </br>
<br> &nbsp &nbsp ✔ GraphPath ( Dijkstra, BFS algorithms ) </br>

<br> This project's final aim was to find ,,All shortest paths'' between specific node and the rest in weighted graph, as u can see below :

<br> We got sample Graph : </br>

<br> We are trying to find all shortest paths between node "0" and the rest, so next steps are as follows :

Done - we found all shortest paths between node "0" and the rest using modified Dijkstra's Algorithm. :)
